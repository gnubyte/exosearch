# Bloom filter explanation

This is sort of a run at how the hell this works.

## Explanation

Here's a simplified explanation of how you can use a Bloom filter to speed up a search through a MongoDB collection field:

1. Create and store Bloom filters: For each record in the MongoDB collection, generate a Bloom filter from the text you want to search through. Store the Bloom filters in a field of each record in the collection.

2. Prepare the search: Determine the keywords you want to search for in the MongoDB collection.

3. Filter using Bloom filters: Iterate over the records in the MongoDB collection and perform the following steps for each record:
   a. Retrieve the Bloom filter stored in the record's field.
   b. Check if the Bloom filter indicates that the keywords might be present in the text.
      - If the Bloom filter returns "false" for any keyword, skip further processing for that record.
      - If the Bloom filter returns "true" for all keywords, proceed to the next step.

4. Perform an exact search: For the records that passed the Bloom filter check, perform an exact search on the text field to confirm if the keywords are actually present. You can use MongoDB's query capabilities, regular expressions, or other search techniques to perform this step.

By using Bloom filters, you can quickly filter out records that are unlikely to contain the keywords you're searching for, thereby reducing the number of exact searches needed. This can significantly speed up the search process, especially when dealing with large collections or complex search queries.

It's important to note that Bloom filters may produce false positives (indicating a keyword is present when it's not), but they will never produce false negatives (indicating a keyword is not present when it is). Therefore, the Bloom filter acts as a probabilistic filter to quickly narrow down the search space, while the exact search step ensures accuracy.

Remember to choose appropriate parameters for your Bloom filters, such as the size and the number of hash functions, to balance between the desired level of accuracy and the desired reduction in search time.
